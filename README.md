# CS-305

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company was looking to protect itself from external threats by implementing the most current software security for their RESTful web application programming interface (API). 

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I think I did particularly well in identifying the external threats that may be present for Artemis Financial. Staying ahead of attack methods such as privilege escalation and abuse of business logic and workflow will help ensure that the company’s assets are not hacked. Insecure software can be detrimental to a company’s well being if their data becomes exposed to attackers. Customers may avoid working with an organization that they cannot trust their information with, especially when it comes to sensitive financial data. 

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found the mitigation plan to be simultaneously helpful and challenging. There were many security practices missing from the code, and many dependencies that needed to be resolved through updates and more. If I were tasked with completing all items on the mitigation plan, I think I may find it a bit daunting. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I took a very thorough approach to assess vulnerabilities, and it was helpful to take notes along the way. As I was examining each vulnerability on the dependency report, I logged the fixes that were noted so that I knew exactly what action was needed for each one. 

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and application were secure, I ran a dependency check. To check if I introduced new vulnerabilities I ran a second dependency check. The HTML report displays the number of vulnerabilities, which is helpful to compare reports.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I think that taking thorough notes inside and outside of the code was very helpful for me. Commenting throughout the code makes things much easier, so that I know exactly what everything is, what changes I made, and why I made those changes. Going through the vulnerabilities systematically made me confident that I wasn’t missing anything.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
From this particular assignment, I would like to showcase my ability to run a dependency check and to successfully identify a fix for each vulnerability. I found it interesting and fun to investigate the causes and solutions for each one.
